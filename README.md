## Description
A way to convert RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) to HLS ( HTTP Live Streaming)

RTSP is mostly used in IP Camera. Javascript based browser's can't stream RTSP directly in browser.

This is a very simple and fast way of Re-stream RTSP.

### Installatin
in `ffmpeg-converter.sh` adjust your `VIDSOURCE` url. It should be your RTSP url.

E.g: `VIDSOURCE="rtsp://user:pass@101.155.220.126:544/Streaming/channels/101"`
